# Portfolio Component Structure

This portfolio has been refactored into a clean, modular structure for better maintainability and organization.

## 📁 File Structure

```
src/
├── app/
│   └── page.tsx                 # Main page (now clean and minimal)
├── components/
│   ├── layout/
│   │   ├── Navigation.tsx       # Navigation bar component
│   │   └── Footer.tsx           # Footer component
│   ├── sections/
│   │   ├── HeroSection.tsx      # Hero/landing section
│   │   ├── AboutSection.tsx     # About me section
│   │   ├── ProjectsSection.tsx  # Projects showcase
│   │   ├── ExperienceSection.tsx # Work experience timeline
│   │   └── ContactSection.tsx   # Contact information
│   └── ui/                      # Reusable UI components (existing)
└── data/
    ├── constants.ts             # Shared constants and personal info
    ├── projects.ts              # Projects data and types
    └── experience.ts            # Experience data and types
```

## 🎯 Benefits of This Structure

1. **Modularity**: Each section is a separate component, making it easy to modify individual parts
2. **Reusability**: Components can be easily reused or moved around
3. **Maintainability**: Data is separated from presentation logic
4. **Scalability**: Easy to add new sections or modify existing ones
5. **Type Safety**: TypeScript interfaces for all data structures

## 📝 How to Update Content

### Personal Information
Edit `src/data/constants.ts` to update:
- Name, title, location
- Social media links
- Quick stats

### Projects
Edit `src/data/projects.ts` to:
- Add new projects
- Update existing project details
- Modify project structure

### Experience
Edit `src/data/experience.ts` to:
- Add new work experience
- Update job details and achievements
- Modify experience structure

### Styling
Each component can be styled independently:
- `HeroSection.tsx` - Landing page styling
- `AboutSection.tsx` - About section styling
- `ProjectsSection.tsx` - Project cards styling
- `ExperienceSection.tsx` - Timeline styling
- `ContactSection.tsx` - Contact form styling

## 🔧 Adding New Sections

1. Create a new component in `src/components/sections/`
2. Add it to the main page in `src/app/page.tsx`
3. Update navigation if needed in `src/components/layout/Navigation.tsx`

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors and Themes
- Update Tailwind classes in individual components
- Modify the gradient backgrounds in `AboutSection.tsx`
- Adjust hover effects and animations

### Layout
- Each section is self-contained and can be reordered
- Responsive design is handled within each component
- Grid layouts can be modified independently

## 📱 Responsive Design

All components are built with responsive design in mind:
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint-specific layouts
- Touch-friendly interactions

## 🚀 Performance

- Components are lazy-loaded by default
- Images are optimized with Next.js Image component
- Minimal bundle size with efficient imports

## 🔄 State Management

- Local state is managed within components (e.g., expanded jobs in ExperienceSection)
- No external state management needed for current features
- Easy to add global state if needed in the future
